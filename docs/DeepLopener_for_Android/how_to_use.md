4. Tap `TRANSLATE` button

    - `DeepLopener` may be hidden in some environment. If so, check `︙` to find it.
    - If you can't find it (Ex. occurs in Gmail), We are so sorry but you can't use this mode by technical issue.
3. The translation window will appear on top of the opening application

4. The translation window will appear on top of the opennig application

## Notification mode
You can't find share or ContextMenu in some application (Ex. long tap to copy text in twitter app).  
This mode may help your experience.  

※ This mode is beta version now. I found a problem that notification will be removed when we close the history of this app on MIUI devices.  

1. Toggle the `Tap to Translate` to enabled.
